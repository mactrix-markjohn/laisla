We are beginning to experience a wave of sustainable prosperity. I appreciate LA ISLA for using the inspiration from the ocean to create swimwear and clothing that is in the spirit of enticing people to be outdoors, to be close to water; to feel, breathe the natural world. We must connect the ocean to the existence of every human being. This is the only way for people to understand that the quality of each and every one of our lives depends on water, depends on the ocean.</p>

Having said that, the amazing staff at LA ISLA, in particular Enrique Sanchez-Rivera have not only met my high expectations, but have exceeded them. The manufacturing has been impeccable, as has been the company’s treatment towards me. They have been there every step of the way, answering every question, helping in every aspect and generally providing a great sense of support as manufacturing partners.
