        <h2>Our Private Label Swimwear Process Is Streamlined, Allowing You To Focus On Your Business
        </h2>
        <p className='Section6DetailedPrivateFirstP'><b>So how does our process work?</b><br/><br/>1. We receive spec sheets for every style, or detailed pictures, or imagery, from you.
<br/><br/>2. We will prepare a quote for you.
<br/><br/>3. If our quote is approved and you decide to start production, we will require a 50% deposit of the total order cost.
</p>
        <div className='Section6DetailedPrivateRow'>
            <img src={model} alt=''/>
            <p>4. Since we offer full package manufacturing, we will NOT charge you for pattern or sample making. We make one sample per style, usually in size small (or any size you decide you want to do fittings with), and send them to you for approval. If you have observations and the samples need to be corrected, we will correct them and send them to you for review. We do NOT charge for grading. Please note that pattern release (if you need the actual pattern files) has a cost of $500 per pattern, as we need to spend time preparing the files for you. Most clients do not request this as we always have them on file for future orders or reorders. But, the option to have your patterns is there if you need them.<br/><br/>
            5. Once all samples are approved, then we start the production of your swimwear. 


<br/><br/>6. When production is ready, we will send you a packing list that itemizes all styles, quantities, and sizes being shipped. Before shipping, we require your final 50% payment. 



            </p>
        </div>
        <p className='Section6DetailedPrivateSecondP'>
        7. All our orders ship out from our factory location in Medellin, Colombia, to our warehouse, where orders are inspected and shipped to your final destination.<br/><br/>
<b>Our full package prices include the following:</b><br/><br/> 


- Pattern making (release of patterns has a $500 cost)<br/>
- Sample making + samples (one sample for each style) - if you we need to make revisions on any of the styles, we will make counter samples as well<br/>
- All fabrics<br/>
- Elastics<br/>
- Labels (printed or woven)<br/>
- Pads<br/>
- Hygienic liners for bottoms (branded if order is above 3,000 units)<br/>
- Individual poly bag for each piece<br/>
- Cut & Sew<br/>
- Cartons (for shipping)<br/>
- Tagging and folding<br/>
<br/><br/>
Last but not least, please know we are always a phone call or a video call away. We pride ourselves in having outstanding customer service, and we stand by our clients through every step of the process. With over twenty years of manufacturing and branded swim experience, we strongly believe we are the best choice for private label swimwear manufacturing for small and medium sized brands.
