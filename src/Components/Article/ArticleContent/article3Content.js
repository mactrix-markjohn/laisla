It has been a rewarding experience and one that has taught me many things but mostly it has given me the most incredible schooling in persistence. If that was a degree, I’d have a PhD in it by now, one that was earned with lots of sweat and tears, but mostly by enjoying the journey. As they say, the journey is the destination!<br/><br/><b>How did I get started?</b><br/><br/>Unlike many apparel companies, mine was started with no investors and I had to bootstrap it every step of the way.";

As I update this article to 2023, I can report and say that we’ve helped a lot of brands at La Isla. I look forward to telling you my own story on another opportunity since I know that my mistakes and successes will indeed help others in their journey. For now, I will highlight some steps which will help you get started in this exciting business.<br/><br/> Approximately three years ago I was sitting at my desk and something very unexpected happened. I went out for a coffee break (now I only drink <b>Love Preferred Coffee Co.</b> coffee ;)) and upon my return I realized that I had been flooded with manufacturing inquiries from all over the country. I was in shock. I had always worked very hard at selling our manufacturing services and getting leads was very difficult. Getting twenty leads in a matter of 45 minutes was a completely new thing for me and LA ISLA. I had no idea what had happened since I never spent any money on advertising.<br/><br/>That day’s inquiries were not even close to any of the inquiries we had received at the trade shows we participated in and we hadn’t hired anyone for SEO. What was happening? All the emails were coming from the contact form on our website. I opted to call one of the people who had written their phone number below their email signature and after thanking them for their interest in LA ISLA, I asked them how they had found us. She said, “well I searched for private label swimwear on Google and your company was the first one that showed up on my search.”<br/><br/>I couldn’t believe it, especially because every search I had done for those keywords in the past 3 years always resulted in us coming in at the 35th or 36th position! As soon as I answered her questions I immediately tried the search and there we were, #1 on Google’s search for private label swimwear. Those are not highly searched words but when people do search them, they are very interested in moving forward with their project. I called friends in every state and in a few countries and for the exception of Canada . . . we ranked #1. It paid off to have started an effective and in-house planned SEO (search engine optimization) program.<br/><br/> ";
